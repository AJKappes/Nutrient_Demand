### Modeling Nutrient Demand in Undernourished Areas

Nutrient demand systems in rural Kenya are estimated for evaluating policy impacts on nutrition throughout severely malnourished environments. Navigate to [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ajkappes/Nutrient_Demand/tree/master/Python/) for viewing formatted Jupyter notebooks (LaTeX math, graphs, etc.).

This project has shifted focus to evaluation of livestock disease on nutrient shadow prices computed in the demand system.
