### Modeling Nutrient Demand in Undernourished Areas

Nutrient demand systems in rural Kenya are estimated for evaluating policy impacts on nutrition throughout malnourished environments. Navigate to [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ajkappes/Nutrient_Demand/tree/master/Python/) for viewing formatted Jupyter notebooks (LaTeX math, graphs, etc.).

A subproject of the demand analysis focuses on evaluation of livestock disease impacts on nutrient shadow prices computed in the demand system.
