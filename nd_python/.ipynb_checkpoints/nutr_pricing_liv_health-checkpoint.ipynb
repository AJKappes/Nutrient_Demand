    "\n",
    "Two analyses were done to evaluate impacts of livestock health on nutrient shadow prices. The first analysis used a fixed effect model to see if livestock health and disease explained significant shifts in nutrient prices. However, the results of each fixed effect model for bovine, goat, and sheep showed no significant effects. The second analysis focused on logisitic regression in order to see odds ratio impacts of livestock general illness on nutrient price."
