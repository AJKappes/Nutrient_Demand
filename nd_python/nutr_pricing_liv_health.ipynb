The first analysis used a fixed effect model to see if livestock health and disease explained significant shifts in nutrient prices. However, the results of each fixed effect model for bovine, goat, and sheep showed no significant effects. The second analysis focused on logistic regression in order to see odds ratio impacts of livestock general illness on nutrient price."

The opposite occurs for negative partial effects - probabilities that nutrient prices are greater than their means when livestock are unhealthy are greater.\n",

For example, looking at bovine consumption and nutrient prices, the positive partial effects reveal greater probabilities of higher nutrient prices when consuming healthy livestock. These greater prices can be a result of lower healthy livestock consumption or greater expense when consuming healthy livestock. Increasing the supply of healthy livestock (i.e. providing the means to produce healthier livestock) can result in lowering the price of healthy livestock consumption."
